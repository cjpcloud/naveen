/**
 * Class to hold all the constant values to be used for logging in the Auth Engine Service.
 * This class contains various constants that are used for structured logging messages
 * throughout the Auth Engine Service.
 *
 * <p>These constants include log messages for different stages of the authorization process,
 * such as entry logs, completion logs, and exception logs. Using constants for log messages
 * helps in maintaining consistency and makes it easier to manage and update log messages
 * across the service.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class is designed to be non-instantiable by having a private constructor,
 * ensuring that it only serves as a container for log message constants.</p>
